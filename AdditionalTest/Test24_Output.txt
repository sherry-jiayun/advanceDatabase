R(T1,x3) & R(T2,x4) & R(T4,x4) will be blocked until 
recover(4) finishes.

After recover(4),
    R(T1,x3) returns 30, since x3 is a unreplicated variable and can be read immediately after server recovery.

    R(T2,x4) is still blocked, because x4 is a replicated variable and can't be read until a write has been performed after recovery.

    R(T3,x4) returns 40, which is the initial value of x4. T3 can read immediately since T3 is a read-only transaction.

After W(T4, x4, 44) finishes,
    R(T2,x4) returns 44.

After all transaction commits, x4 will be 44, other variables will stay the same.
