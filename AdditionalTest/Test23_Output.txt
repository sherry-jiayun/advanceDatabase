Blocking graph:

T4 <--- T3 <--- T1
        |       ^
        |       |
        \-----> T2

T1 ---> T3 means T1 blocks T3.

T4 is the youngest transaction among all blocked transactions,
but T3 is the youngest transaction in the deadlock cycle,
thus T3 should be aborted during deadlock detection.

T1, T2 and T4 should commit.
